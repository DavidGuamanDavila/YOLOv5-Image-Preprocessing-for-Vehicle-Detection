# YOLOv5-Image-Preprocessing-for-Vehicle-Detection
## Exploring Image Preprocessing for Improved Vehicle Detection using YOLOv5

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to apply some of the image processing techniques that we were taught in this course on images that are input to a You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5 model trained on vehicle classification and examine the effects of each process on the performance of the model. We will also be comparing our results with those obtained from inputting the unmodified images into the model. 

Specifically, this project will explore the effects of inputting the following three different versions of the same test images on the performance of the YOLOv5 model, i.e, how accurately it is able to detect and classify different vehicles: 
 - from an Unmodified RGB image that we captured around campus 
 - from the conversion of a given test image to its intensity image (as seen in the HSI sections of this course)
 - from the sharpened image using an unsharp mask (using elements of our solution to Assignment 2) upon the now-greyscaled image.

2. Template_Files
   - 2.1. camera_obj_detection_template.py: script that uses the Intel RealSense D435 Camera and YOLOv5 weight to detect vehicles on a live feed from the camera. Bounding boxes are generated around detected objects. This file does not have established paths to required files i.e. template.
   - 2.2. single_image_object_detection_template.py: script that uses an image and the YOLOv5 weight performs object detection. The result is a saved image with the bounding boxes around objects that have been detected. This file does not have established paths to required files i.e. template.
   - 2.3. folder_images_object_detection.py: script that iterates through images from a directory, and the YOLOv5 weight performs object detection on all of the images. The result images after object detection are saved into a new directory, and the images have bounding boxes around objects that have been detected.This file does not have established paths to required files i.e. template.

The following is an example of how to run the script:

More information on the dataset can be found below. The original training notebook created by Roboflow can be found here https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov5-object-detection-on-custom-data.ipynb. These resources can also be found in the Resources section of this ReadMe.md file.
